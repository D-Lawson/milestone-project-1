# Snowdonia Breaks

This website is intended to provide a captivating user experience for prospective customers of a holiday cottage based in Snowdonia, North Wales.  This in turn should lead to frequent conversions for our client Snowdonia Breaks.   

The goal is to showcase the product in its best light to attract the maximum number of guests.  The website seeks to do this by providing a minimal and natural look, yet with a strong presence and demonstration of the holiday experience.

# UX
## Who is the audience?

Individuals who are seeking self-catering accommodation in Snowdonia, North Wales.   Typical customers include groups of hikers/climbers, people who want to book a break and those who wish to explore what Snowdonia has to offer.   As a holiday cottage this property will have extra appeal for those actively seeking a traditional holiday cottage that can sleep up to 14 guests.

## The site owner

The owner seeks to obtain the maximum number of conversions to fill out the annual booking calendar.  The owner wishes to develop the brand image and increase demand for their accommodation.   The owner wishes to obtain contact details of site visitors in order to form a mailing list.  

## Typical user stories to expect:

1. As a member of a climbing group, I want to find suitable accommodation on the 1st of May that can house 8 climbers.  It needs to be within our budget and the hope is for the overall trip to be a memorable one, with some interesting facilities local to the accommodation.  The hope is that this will make it a good proposition for all, be able to relax properly at the end of each day which will add value to our climbing trip.

1. As a family of 5, we are looking for an ideal getaway for half term.  We’d like the children to be able to have fun outside the accommodation, with plenty to do in the area.  As parents we wouldn’t mind a bit of luxury either.  This would make it a family break to remember.

There seems to be a significant variance in the potential stories that we can expect.  This suggests that we should try to maintain some neutrality while focusing on the service itself and the value propositions of it.  

## The Strategy Plane

We wanted this website to showcase the accommodation in its best light to help the audience visualise the holiday experience.  This will require little distraction from the product and focus on aiding visualisation of the experience.  A call to action will need to be intuitive and readily available for the users at any given point during their exploration of the website.   

Website user objectives:

* Find the ideal destination for their holiday that meets the group’s needs.
* Secure accommodation within their budget, in the dates required.
* See description and photographs of the accommodation facilities.
* Find out more about facilities and special interests local to the accommodation.
* View previous guest experiences
* Contact the accommodation owner

Website owner objectives: 

* Obtain maximum number of conversions to fill up the booking calendar
* Build an online presence.
* Increase brand awareness and demand for the property.  
* Obtain contact details of site visitors to form a mailing list.

Feasibility chart:

The project appears to lack in feasibility in some areas, I’d attribute these to current time constraints and capacity to deliver on some (Accessibility, SEO, demonstrating availability, increasing brand awareness).  Overall the project has a good viability score so we should be able to deliver on the key objectives.

## The Scope Plane

I have decided to include these features as priorities:

*	Navigation bar across the top with internal links 
*	Home page with hero image and accommodation overview
*	The Cottage page with descriptions and gallery features
*	The Local Area page with summary of local attractions and a location map
*	Contact/booking page to contact the owner and/or place a booking/check availability. Option to receive promotional emails when entering email into contact form.
*	Footer to include social media links
*	Prominent call to action available on each page to contact owner, or place booking.

## The Structure Plane

The header is to include a navigation bar to the following internal pages:

*	Home
*	The Cottage
*	The Local Area
*	Contact Us

The navigation bar will also include a Book Now option which will take the user to an external bookings platform.

The header will also include a Snowdonia Breaks logo on the top left.

### Home

The home page will include a hero image along with a centered title with caption placed onto the hero image.  Below the hero image there will be a 3 column layout to prompt the user to proceed to 1. The Cottage page, 2. The Local Area page, 3.  The Contact/bookings page.

### The Cottage

This will provide a description of the features of the accommodation, supported by gallery elements.  The gallery elements will be a combination of static images and a carousel. 

### The Local Area

This will be modelled from the structure of the Cottage page, but will include an overview of some local attractions supported by gallery elements. 

### Contact Us

This page will feature a form to contact the owner to make an enquiry, with the option to opt in to promotional emails when supplying their email.  A book now button will also be prominent on this page and will direct the user to an external bookings platform.
